BungeeCord for 1.7/1.8/1.9/1.10/1.11/1.12/1.13/1.14/1.15/1.16/1.17/1.18/1.19/1.20
==========
This is a fork of md_5's BungeeCord  
https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/1-8-1-9-bungeecord.392/

This version reimplements Minecraft 1.7.10 and basic 1.7.10 Forge support.

IMPORTANT: There are some bugs but those will take time to fix!
This fork is designed for keeping your old servers in your network, until your modpacks are available for more recent mc versions.
Most of them are, so get rid of 1.7 fast and move to newer modpacks asap.

PLEASE: Only use this fork if really needed.(1.7 legacy servers.) If you dont need 1.7 or Sponge support, grab original BungeeCord. Link is above.

Layer 7 proxy designed to link Minecraft servers.
--------------------------------------------------

BungeeCord is a sophisticated proxy and API designed mainly to teleport players between multiple Minecraft servers. It is the latest incarnation of similar software written by the author from 2011-present.

Information
-----------
BungeeCord is maintained by [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/) and has its own [discussion thread](https://www.spigotmc.org/go/bungeecord) with plenty of helpful information and links.

### Security warning

As your Minecraft servers have to run without authentication (online-mode=false) for BungeeCord to work, this poses a new security risk. Users may connect to your servers directly, under any username they wish to use. The kick "If you wish to use IP forwarding, please enable it in your BungeeCord config as well!" does not protect your Spigot servers.

To combat this, you need to restrict access to these servers for example with a firewall (please see [firewall guide](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/firewall-guide/)).
